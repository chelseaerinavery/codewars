# Codewars

A place to put my (almost) daily katas, and the lessons + victories that they bring.

## How?

Vanilla JS of solved katas in files that I create and push to GitHub on the regular. Since I began this repo after already solving over 50 katas, you will see a variety of difficulty levels. Click the link to my Codewars profile above to check out some of my previous solutions.

## Why?

Practicing katas is where I get to learn more about, polish, and practice all that JavaScript has to offer. I always see real improvements when I integrate what I learn in katas into actual products and code bases.
